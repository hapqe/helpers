to list all sound cards, you first have to install the alsa-utils package:
sudo pacman -S alsa-utils

Then you can list all sound cards with the following command:
aplay -l

Now there should be multiple sound, but one should have "intel" in the name.

now open the alsa config under /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf
those 3 lines should all have the index of the before mentioned sound card:
defaults.pcm.card 1
defaults.pcm.device 0
defaults.ctl.card 1
